The title of my site is Star Wars Character Search. My website searches through the original Star Wars characters and give you the physical attributes of them. I implemented a search bar to filter through the API data that I transfered into JSON. The user flow is simple, search for a character and it returns their attributes. Here is the link to find my api for people https://swapi.dev/api/ I tried numerous different methods to get the search bar to work. I ultimately went with JavaScript. The deployment link is https://capstone-1-1-9aqy.onrender.com
